# SentinelDesk

SentinelDesk is a modular technical analysis and diagnostic tool focused on defensive auditing in Windows environments.

Developed by PaulNeja, founder of the independent cybersecurity research group PN Security.

## General Description

SentinelDesk has been designed as a local technical evaluation tool intended to perform preliminary analysis of operating system configurations, services, and behaviors.

Its purpose is to provide a structured foundation for defensive technical inspection within personal or properly authorized environments.

The project is currently in an advanced experimental stage. Although the core functionality required for operation works correctly, the application is not free from minor errors, visual details pending optimization, or non-critical behaviors that will be progressively corrected in future versions.

---

## Project Status

The current version should be considered functional but experimental.

This implies:

The main logical core operates correctly.

Essential functions are operational.

Visual imperfections may exist.

Non-critical errors may occur.

Unexpected behavior may appear in certain environments.

Development remains active, and structural improvements, internal optimization, and bug fixes are planned for future releases.

## Versioning Model

A clear separation between two branches is planned:

### Stable Versions

Higher level of validation.

Focus on reliability.

Consolidated functionality.

Lower probability of failures.

### Development Versions (DEV)

Experimental nature.

Early integration of new features.

Greater likelihood of errors, unstable behavior, or unexpected failures.

Not recommended for critical or production use.

DEV versions may experience crashes, inconsistencies, or structural changes without prior notice.

## Scope and Limitations

SentinelDesk:

Does not replace certified professional auditing tools.

Does not substitute specialized commercial solutions.

Does not constitute a complete penetration testing framework.

Should not be considered a forensic expert tool.

It is primarily intended as a preliminary, exploratory, or educational analysis tool within controlled environments.

Its use must be carried out under technical judgment and individual responsibility.

# Note Regarding VirusTotal Analysis

The file has been analyzed on VirusTotal. Some heuristic engines may flag the compilation as suspicious due to packaging with PyInstaller (--onefile) and the use of system process execution.

These detections are generic (AI/heuristic-based) and do not correspond to real malware.

The official build is digitally signed and can be verified using the SHA256 fingerprint published in this repository.

The full source code is available in this same repository for independent review and verification.

SentinelDesk does not contain malicious code.
